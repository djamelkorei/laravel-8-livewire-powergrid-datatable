# Laravel 8 - Livewire PowerGrid DataTable

This guide walks you through the process of building a Laravel 8 application that uses Livewire and PowerGrid DataTable.

Check this tutorial on my [Blog](https://dev.djamelkorei.me/laravel-8-livewire-powergrid-datatable) ðŸ‘‹
## What You Will build
You will build a Laravel application with quick datatable fully configurable.

## What You Need
- A favorite text editor or IDE
- PHP >= 7.3
- Composer
- Node.js
- Npm

## Setup A New Project 
Create a new Laravel project by using Composer:
```bash
composer create-project laravel/laravel laravel-8-livewire-powergrid-datatable
cd laravel-8-livewire-powergrid-datatable
php artisan serve
``` 

#### Installing Livewire
```
composer require livewire/livewire
```
#### Installing PowerGrid
```
composer require power-components/livewire-powergrid
```
#### Installing Tailwind
PowerGrid use Tailwind or Bootstrap to style the datatable, in this tutorial we use tailwind.
```
npm install -D tailwindcss@latest postcss@latest autoprefixer@latest
```
Generate the tailwind.config.js file:

```
npx tailwindcss init
```
This will create a `tailwind.config.js` file at the root of your project, configure the `purge` option:
```js
module.exports = {
   purge: [],
   purge: [
     './resources/**/*.blade.php',
     './resources/**/*.js',
     './resources/**/*.vue',
   ],
    darkMode: false, // or 'media' or 'class'
    theme: {
      extend: {},
    },
    variants: {
      extend: {},
    },
    plugins: [],
  }
```
In your `webpack.mix.js`, add tailwindcss as a PostCSS plugin:
```js
  mix.js("resources/js/app.js", "public/js")
    .postCss("resources/css/app.css", "public/css", [
     require("tailwindcss"),
    ]);
```
Open the `./resources/css/app.css` and the `@tailwind` directive to include Tailwindâ€™s base, components, and utilities styles, replacing the original file contents:
```scss
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```
#### Finalizing The Installation
```
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Configure Database
go to you `.env` file & update the database variables
```
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE= #you_database_name
DB_USERNAME= #your_username
DB_PASSWORD= #your_password
```
## Setup The Product Model
Create a new model using the Artisan CLI's command, `-mf` flag to create a migration and a factory for the product model
```
php artisan make:model Product -mf
``` 

#### Update The Migration Class
Go to the file `database/migrations/xxxx_xx_xx_xxxxxx_create_products_table.php` and update the table columns
```php
/**
 * Run the migrations.
 *
 * @return void
 */
public function up()
{
    Schema::create('products', function (Blueprint $table) {
        $table->id();
        $table->string('name');
        $table->double('price', 8, 2);
        $table->boolean('active');
        $table->timestamps();
    });
}
```

#### Update The Models
Go to the file `app/Models/Product.php` and update the product model class
```php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Factories\HasFactory;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Product extends Model
{
    use HasFactory;
    protected $fillable = ['name', 'price', 'active'];
}
```
#### Update The Product Factory Class
Go to the file `database/factories/ProductFactory.php` and update the factory class
```php
<?php

namespace Database\Factories;

use App\Models\User;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Factories\Factory;

class ProductFactory extends Factory
{
    /**
     * Define the model's default state.
     *
     * @return array
     */
    public function definition()
    {
        return [
            'name' => $this->faker->word(),
            'price' => $this->faker->randomNumber(2),
            'active' => $this->faker->boolean(),
            'user_id' => User::factory()
        ];
    }
}
```

#### Create New Records With Tinker
Before start creating the records, you should migrate the product table using Artisan CLI's command
```
php artisan migrate
```  
- Run the `tinker` Artisan command
- Create the product records

```
php artisan tinker 
App\Models\Product::factory()->count(50)->create();
```
## Create PowerGrid Product Table View
To create a PowerGrid table, run the following command:
```
php artisan powergrid:create ProductTable --model="App\Models\Product" --fillable
``` 
Now open the file `resources/views/welcome.blade.php` and update it:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="{{ str_replace('_', '-', app()->getLocale()) }}">

<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <title>Laravel 8 - Livewire PowerGrid Datatable</title>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <link href="{{ asset('css/app.css') }}" rel="stylesheet">
    {{-- styles --}}
    @livewireStyles
    @powerGridStyles
</head>

<body>
    <div class="min-h-screen bg-gray-100">
        <div class="py-12">
            <div class="max-w-7xl mx-auto sm:px-6 lg:px-8">
                <div class="bg-white overflow-hidden shadow-xl sm:rounded-lg p-5">

                    {{-- Product PowerGrid Tag --}}
                    <livewire:product-table />

                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    {{-- scripts --}}
    @livewireScripts
    @powerGridScripts
</body>

</html>
```

## Testing your application

Generally speaking, tests are a "control check" to guarantee that your application does what it is intended to do. Tests give you confidence that everything is working as it should.

Running tests is also very helpful when we must refactor our code or upgrade a framework version.

To get started, you need to install [Pest PHP](http://pestphp.com) with the Laravel and the Livewire Plugin.

Run each of the 4 commands below:

```shell
composer require pestphp/pest --dev --with-all-dependencies

composer require pestphp/pest-plugin-laravel --dev

php artisan pest:install

composer require pestphp/pest-plugin-livewire --dev
```

At this point, you are ready to create your test.

Run the command below:

```shell
php artisan make:test ProductTableTest --pest
```

You should now have a new file named: `tests/Feature/ProductTableTest.php`.

Open the file and replace its content with:

```php
<?php
use App\Models\Product;
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

test('Database has products', function () {
    $products = Product::all();

    expect($products->count())->toBeGreaterThan(0);
});

test('Product table renders successfully', function () {
    $this->get('/')
        ->assertOK()
        ->assertSeeLivewire('product-table');
});
```

The first test is verifying that the database has products.

The second test verifies (assert) that your home page can be rendered without errors (assertOK) and that it contains the Livewire components `product-table`.

Now, you can run your tests with the command and verify if both tests will âœ… Pass:

```shell
php artisan test
```

## Serve your project
First run the the command bellow for compiling new assets 
```
npm run dev
```
We are ready to run our application
```
php artisan serve
```
Now you can open the URL bellow on your browser
```
http://localhost:8000
```
## Summary

Congratulations ðŸŽ‰ ! You have create quick datatable using Laravel 8. You did it without having to write a single line of code and that is with the help of PowerGrid Datatable.
